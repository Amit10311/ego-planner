## 1. Quick Start

# Quick Start within 3 Minutes 

Compiling tests passed on ubuntu **16.04, 18.04** with ros installed.
You can just execute the following commands one by one.

The project is developed and tested in Ubuntu 16.04, ROS Kinetic. Run the following commands to setup:

```
  sudo apt-get install libnlopt-dev libarmadillo-dev
  cd ${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/src
  git clone https://github.com/Amit10311/ego-planner.git 
  cd ego-planner
  catkin_make
  source devel/setup.bash
  roslaunch ego_planner simple_run.launch
```



# Acknowledgements
- The framework of this repository is based on [Fast-Planner](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner) by Zhou Boyu who achieves impressive proformance on quaorotor local planning.

- The L-BFGS solver we use is from [LBFGS-Lite](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/LBFGS-Lite). 
It is a C++ head-only single file, which is lightweight and easy to use.


# EGO-Planner 
EGO-Planner: An ESDF-free Gradient-based Local Planner for Quadrotors

**EGO-Planner** is a lightweight gradient-based local planner without ESDF construction, which significantly reduces computation time compared to some state-of-the-art methods <!--(EWOK and Fast-Planner)-->. The total planning time is only **around 1ms** and don't need to compute ESDF.

## 2. Algorithms and Papers

The project contains a collection of robust and computationally efficient algorithms for quadrotor fast flight:
* Kinodynamic path searching
* B-spline-based trajectory optimization
* Topological path searching and path-guided optimization
* Perception-aware planning strategy (to appear)

These methods are detailed in our papers listed below. 

Please cite at least one of our papers if you use this project in your research: [Bibtex](files/bib.txt).

All planning algorithms along with other key modules, such as mapping, are implemented in __fast_planner__:

- __plan_env__: The online mapping algorithms. It takes in depth image (or point cloud) and camera pose (odometry) pairs as input, do raycasting to update a probabilistic volumetric map, and build an Euclidean signed distance filed (ESDF) for the planning system. 
- __path_searching__: Front-end path searching algorithms. 
  Currently it includes a kinodynamic path searching that respects the dynamics of quadrotors.
  It also contains a sampling-based topological path searching algorithm to generate multiple topologically distinctive paths that capture the structure of the 3D environments. 
- __bspline__: A implementation of the B-spline-based trajectory representation.
- __bspline_opt__: The gradient-based trajectory optimization using B-spline trajectory.
- __active_perception__: Perception-aware planning strategy, which enable to quadrotor to actively observe and avoid unknown obstacles, to appear in the future.
- __plan_manage__: High-level modules that schedule and call the mapping and planning algorithms. Interfaces for launching the whole system, as well as the configuration files are contained here.

## 2. Standard Compilation

**Requirements**: ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 or 20.04 with ros-desktop-full installation.

**Step 1**. Install [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/), which is required by **uav_simulator**.
```
sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev
``` 

**Step 2**. Clone the code from github or gitee. This two repositories synchronize automaticly.

From github,
```
git clone https://github.com/bigsuperZZZX/ego-planner.git
```


**Step 3**. Compile,
```
cd ego-planner
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

**Step 4**. Run.

In a terminal at the _ego-planner/_ folder, open the rviz for visuallization and interactions
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ego_planner rviz.launch
```

In another terminal at the _ego-planner/_, run the planner in simulation by
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ego_planner run_in_sim.launch
```

Then you can follow the gif below to control the drone.
